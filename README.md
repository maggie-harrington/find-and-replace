## Specifications
* Phase 1 - Dependencies and .gitignore.
* Phase 2 - FindAndReplace class: exceptions property and empty constructor, getter, setter and checkArray() methods.
* Phase 3 - Build Test cases and implement FindAndReplace methods

| Behavior - What does checkArray() return?                      | Input                       | Output                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
|  User enters phrase                                            |  I have a cat               |                            |
|  User enters search word                                       |  cat                        |                            |
|  User enters word to replace                                   |  "dog"                      |                            |
|  String is split into array                                    |  I have a cat               | ["I", "have", "a", "cat"]  |
|  Replace search word in phrase                                 |  cat                        |  dog                       |
|  Check for multiple instances of search word                   |  I have a cat and a cat     |  I have a dog and a dog    |
|  Convert array back to string and return phrase with new word  |  ["I", "have", "a", "dog"]  |  I have a dog              |

* Phase 4 - Initial Silex framework with "Hello" on home page
* Phase 5 - Create twig framework with a form to enter phrase, search word, and word to replace.
